/**
 * Event-driven session self-termination
 *
 * Event-driven (trigger) invocations are fire-and-forget: the Trigger Lambda
 * sends the request and returns immediately without consuming the NDJSON
 * stream. Once the agent finishes processing, nothing on the client side
 * tells AgentCore Runtime that the session is done, so the microVM is only
 * reclaimed after the idle timeout (default 900s) elapses — billing memory
 * the whole time.
 *
 * Interactive (chat) invocations don't have this problem: the frontend reads
 * the stream to completion and the session naturally goes Idle, and we WANT
 * the microVM to stay warm so follow-up turns reuse the same context.
 *
 * For the event path there is no follow-up turn, so as soon as the response
 * has been fully written we proactively call `StopRuntimeSession` on our own
 * session. AgentCore's docs state this "instantly terminates the specified
 * session and stops any ongoing streaming responses" — so it MUST run only
 * after `res.end()`, otherwise it would cut off the response we just sent.
 *
 * ## Obtaining our own Runtime ARN
 *
 * `StopRuntimeSession` requires the runtime ARN. We cannot inject it via a
 * CDK environment variable because `runtime.agentRuntimeArn` is a CloudFormation
 * `GetAtt` on the same resource — feeding it back into that resource's own
 * `environmentVariables` creates a circular dependency. Instead we recover it
 * from `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_URL`, which the AgentCore platform injects at runtime
 * (not via the CDK resource definition, so no cycle). Its path segment carries
 * the URL-encoded ARN:
 *
 *   https://bedrock-agentcore.<region>.amazonaws.com/runtimes/<url-encoded-arn>/invocations
