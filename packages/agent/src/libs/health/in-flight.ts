/**
 * In-flight invocation tracker for the `/ping` health endpoint.
 *
 * WHY this exists
 * ---------------
 * AgentCore Runtime decides a session is **Idle** — and reclaims its microVM by
 * sending SIGTERM — when it observes no activity. Synchronous `InvokeAgentRuntime`
 * calls are auto-tracked by the platform, BUT a long agent turn that streams for
 * minutes (tool execution, sub-agent invokes, gaps between model chunks) can be
 * misread as Idle, especially with a shortened `idleRuntimeSessionTimeout`. When
 * that happens mid-turn, the container is killed after a tool's `toolUse` was
 * persisted but before its `toolResult` — corrupting the saved history.
 *
 * The platform's escape hatch: the agent reports `HealthyBusy` from its health
 * ping while it is genuinely busy, and the platform keeps the session Active.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for "is a turn currently running":
 * `handleInvocation` brackets each turn with {@link beginInvocation} /
 * {@link endInvocation}, and {@link handlePing} reports `HealthyBusy` whenever
 * {@link isBusy} is true.
 *
 * A process-global counter is the right scope here: AgentCore pins one session
 * to one microVM (one process), and `/ping` is process-wide. A simple module
 * singleton therefore mirrors exactly what the platform is asking about — no
 * per-request context plumbing required.
